Our posturings, our imagined self-importance, the delusion that we have some privileged position in the Universe, are challenged by this point of pale light.

\chapter{Visualization in Bioinformatics}

\newthought{A single point in a photograph can represent our whole known world}, as shown in the famous image acquired by the Voyager 1 spacecraft in 1990. From that perspective, is impossible to perceive  all details that conform our planet, from rivers to highways, from mountains to buildings, even countries or full continents and oceans are undistinguished in the mentioned picture. Nonetheless, the image gave us a insight of the vastness of the universe in comparison with our known world.

As in the previous example the same object can be seen from different perspectives each of them will highlight some features and hide others, hence the importance of choosing the right representation for the object in display.

%However most of those efforts are tied to specific projects or in the best cases to specific types of data, and interaction between visualization tools abroad several domains is virtually non existing, and often is limited to links between web resources.

%We tackle this issue by proposing a software architecture of multi-domain visualization components that allows interaction between, making possible to analyse data from more than one domain in a single view. The tool that implements such architecture is web based, developed with HTML5 and using BioJS components as the standard base to allow communication between components.

, then BioJS is described in depth, including a set of components that have been developed. A section describing a tool for the visualisation of protein-protein interactions
