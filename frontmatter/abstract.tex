The most recent advances in laboratory techniques aimed at observing and measuring biological processes are characterised by their ability to generate of large amounts of data. The more data we gather, the better the chances to find clues to understand the systems of life. This, however, is only true if the methods that analyse the generated data are efficient, effective, and robust enough to overcome the challenges intrinsic to the management of big data.

The computational tools designed to overcome these challenges should also take into account the requirements of today's research: science demands specialised knowledge for understanding the particularities of each study focus; and simultaneously, it is seldom possible to describe a single observation without considering its relationship with other processes, entities or systems.

This thesis explores two closely related fields: the integration and visualisation of biological data. We believe that these two branches of study are fundamental to the creation of scientific software tools that respond to the ever increasing needs.

The distributed annotation system (DAS) is a community project that supports the integration of data from federated sources and its visualisation on web and stand-alone clients. We have extended the DAS protocol to improve its search capabilities and also to support feature annotation by the community. We have also collaborated on the implementation of MyDAS, a server to facilitate the publication of biological data following the DAS protocol, and contributed in the design of the protein DAS client called DASty. Furthermore, we have developed a tool called probeSearcher, which uses the DAS technology to facilitate the identification of microarray chips that include probes for mapping proteins of interest.

Another community project in which we participated is BioJS, an open source library of visualisation components for biological data. This thesis includes a description of the project, our contributions to it and some developed components that are part of it.

We combined several BioJS components over a modular architecture to create PINV, a web based visualiser of protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks, that takes advantage of the features of modern web technologies in order to explore PPI datasets on an almost ubiquitous platform (the web) and facilitates the collaboration between scientific peers. This thesis includes the description of the design and development processes of PINV, as well as current use cases that have benefit from the tool and which feedback has been the source of several improvements in PINV.

Collectively, this thesis describes novel software tools that, by using modern web technologies, facilitates the integration, exploration and visualisation of biological data, which contributes to our understanding of the systems of life.
